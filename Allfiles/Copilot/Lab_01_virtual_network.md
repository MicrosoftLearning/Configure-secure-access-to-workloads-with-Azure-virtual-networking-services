# Lab: Provide network isolation and segmentation for the web application

## Scenario

The IT department needs network isolation and segmentation for the web application. To provide network isolation and segmentation for the web application, you need to create an Azure virtual network with subnets that the IT team provided. Once the virtual network is created, the next step is to configure virtual network peering. This allows the virtual networks to communicate with each other securely and privately.
