## Demonstration – Create and Configure Virtual Networks and peering

In this demonstration, we will explore virtual networks. 
1.  [Slide] Before beginning the demonstration, let's review what virtual networks are and key concepts for Azure Virtual Networks. Use this slide to highlight the capabilities of Azure Virtual Networks. As well as Azure Virtual Network concepts and best practices. As you demonstrate creating a virtual network you can explain the basic concepts of address space, subnets, regions, and subscriptions. You could also discuss these slides at the end and get straight into the demonstration.
 
2.	Access the Azure portal.
3.	In the search box, type Virtual Network. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input.
4.	Select Virtual Network.
5.	Click Create.
6.	Explain the Azure portal provides an easy-to-use interface. Items marked with a red asterisk are required.
7.	Select the available subscription.
8.	Select the available resource group.
9.	Enter a name for your virtual network. Point out the opportunity for naming conventions.
10.	[Slide] Select a region for your network. Use this slide to discuss Azure geographies. 
11. [Slide] Select the Security tab. Use this slide to highlight the security services briefly, these topics will be covered in more detail later in the course. Learn more, Services that can be deployed into a virtual network. Note we are only covering a few things to get the student started on their first lab.   
12.	[Slide] Select the IP Addresses tab. Use this slide to review: Plan virtual networks and subnets. Add or modify a subnet to demonstrate to students how to configure subnets. 
13.	Click Review and ensure there are no validation errors.
14.	Click Create and wait for the virtual network to be deployed. Point out the notification messages. 
15.	Show how to go to the resource.
16.	Repeat the process of creating another virtual network so you can demonstrate VNet Peering.
17.	Once you have 2 virtual networks, return to the first vnet you created, under Settings select Peering. 
18.	Select Add, ⓘ provide the configuration details while explaining to the students how to complete the peering.  
19.	Select Add, and show the peering status as connected. 
20.	Return to the slide deck.
