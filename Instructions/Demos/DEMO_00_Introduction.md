## Demonstration - Student materials and lab environment (optional)

Use this demonstration to show students how to access the lab environment and student materials. You can do this at the beginning of class or before the next demonstration. 

### Show students the lab environment (adjust for your lab hoster)

- Discuss how students access the lab environment. 

- Explain how to sign-in to the virtual machine host.

- Explain how to access the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). It is preferred to open the Azure portal in the lab environment instead of a separate window. Ask for a show of hands on how many students have used the portal. 

- Explain what resources have already been configured for the labs.

- Review how to use the lab instructions. 

- Add other topics specific to your hoster. 

### Show students their course materials.

- Access the [Microsoft Learn page](https://learn.microsoft.com).

- Discuss that Microsoft Learn is a great source for all Azure documentation, training, certifications, and assessments. 

- Select **Learning Paths** and then search for the **Configure secure access to your workloads using Azure virtual networking** learning path.

- Discuss that the content in the learning path is specific to this assessment, but there is much more storage content they can review.

- Explain the content is reference material and there isn't a 1:1 mapping with the classroom presentations.

- Discuss that each of these modules may have additional hands-on activities. You will identify these activities as the course progresses. 

- Ask the students to locate and bookmark the learning path.
