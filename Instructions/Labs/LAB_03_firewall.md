# Exercise 03: Create and configure Azure Firewall

## Scenario

Your organization requires centralized network security for the application virtual network. As the application usage increases, more granular application-level filtering and advanced threat protection will be needed. Also, it is expected the application will need continuous updates from Azure DevOps pipelines. You identify these requirements.
+ Azure Firewall is required for additional security in the app-vnet. 
+ A **firewall policy** should be configured to help manage access to the application. 
+ A firewall policy **application rule** is required. This rule will allow the application access to Azure DevOps so the application code can be updated. 
+ A firewall policy **network rule** is required. This rule will allow DNS resolution. 

### Skilling tasks

+ Create an Azure Firewall.
+ Create and configure a firewall policy
+ Create an application rule collection.
+ Create a network rule collection.

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**.

### Update the Firewall Policy

1. In the portal, search for and select `Firewall Policies`. 

1. Select **fw-policy**.

### Add an application rule

1. In the **Settings** blade, select **Application rules** and then **Add a rule collection**.

1. Configure the application rule collection and then select **Add**. 

    | Property               | Value                                     |

+ [Introduction to Azure Firewall](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/introduction-azure-firewall/). In this module, you learn about how Azure Firewall features, rules, deployment options, and administration.
+ [Introduction to Azure Firewall Manager](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/intro-to-azure-firewall-manager/). In this moudle, you learn how Azure Firewall Manager provides central security policy and route management for cloud-based security perimeters.

### Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the exercise. Here are the main takeaways:

+ Azure Firewall is a cloud-based security service that protects your Azure virtual network resources from incoming and outgoing threats.
+ An Azure firewall policy is a resource that contains one or more collections of NAT, network, and application rules.
+ Network rules allow or deny traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
+ Application rules allow or deny traffic based on fully qualified domain names (FQDNs), URLs, and HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
