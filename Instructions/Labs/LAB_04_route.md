# Exercise 04: Configure network routing

## Scenario

To ensure the firewall policies are enforced, outbound application traffic must be routed through the firewall. You identify these requirements. 
+ A route table is required. This route table will be associated with the frontend and backend subnets.  
+ A route is required to filter all outbound IP traffic from the subnets to the firewall. The firewallâ€™s private IP address will be used. 

## Skilling tasks

+ Create and configure a route table.
+ Link a route table to a subnet.

## Exercise instructions

### Create a route table

Azure automatically creates a [route table](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview) for each subnet within an Azure virtual network. The route table includes the default [system  routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview#system-routes). You can create route tables and routes to override Azure's default system routes.

**Record the private IP address of app-vnet-firewall**

1. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Firewall**. Select **Firewall** in the search results.

1. Select **app-vnet-firewall**.

1. Select **Overview** and record the **Private IP address**.

**Add the route table**

1. In the search box, enter **Route tables**. When Route table appears in the search results, select it.

1. In the Route table page, select **+ Create** and create the route table. 

    | Property       | Value                        |
    | :------------- | :--------------------------- |
    | Subscription   | **Select your subscription** |
    | Resource group | **RG1**                      |
    | Region         | **East US**                  |
    | Name           | `app-vnet-firewall-rt`     |

1. Select **Review + create** and then select **Create**.

1. Wait for the route table to deploy, then select **Go to resource**.  

### Associate the route table to the subnets

1. In the portal, continue working with the route table, select **app-vnet-firewall-rt**.

1. In the **Settings** blade, select **Subnets** and then **+ Associate**.

1. Configure an association to the frontend subnet, then select **OK**.  

    | Property        | Value              |
    | :-------------- | :----------------- |
    | Virtual network | **app-vnet (RG1)** |
    | Subnet          | **frontend**       |

1. Configure an association to the backend subnet, then select **OK**.  

    | Property        | Value              |
    | :-------------- | :----------------- |
    | Virtual network | **app-vnet (RG1)** |
    | Subnet          | **frontend**       |

### Create a route in the route table

1. In the portal, continue working with the route table, select **app-vnet-firewall-rt**.

1. In the **Settings** blade, select **Routes** and then **+ Add**.

1. Configure the route, then select **Add**. 

    | Property                            | Value                                                   |
    | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Route name                          | **outbound-firewall**                                   |
    | Destination type                    | **IP addresses**                                        |
    | Destination IP addresses/CIDR range | **0.0.0.0/0**                                           |
    | Next hop type                       | **Virtual appliance**                                   |
    | Next hop address                    | **private IP address of the firewall** |


### Learn more with online training

+ [Manage and control traffic flow in your Azure deployment with routes](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/). In this module, you learn how to control Azure virtual network traffic by implementing custom routes. This module has two sandboxes. 

### Key takeaways

Congratulations on completing the exercise. Here are the main takeaways:

+ Network traffic in Azure is automatically routed across Azure subnets, virtual networks, and on-premises networks. System routes control this routing.
+ User-defined routes override the default system routes so traffic can be routed through a network virtual appliances (NVAs). 
+ Network virtual appliances (NVAs) control the flow of network traffic. Examples of NVAs are firewalls, load balancers, and routers.
+ Route tables contain routing information and are associated with a subnet.
